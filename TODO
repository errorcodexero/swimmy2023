OpenQuestions
-------------
The Y & B buttons are used to reset the swerve drive pose if it is off.  Previously
this was really just about the angle, but now, since the X and Y values matter with
vision, we may make vision and our auto operations inoperable.  Should we have a way
to drive the camera to an april tag and press X & A to reset pose to the vision pose?
